# Case-Study-Carvana
Context:
- Carvana reconditions used cars that it buys from wholesale auctions and individuals to ready them for resale to customers
- Reconditioning entails receiving the cars at one of our many Inspection Centers (ICs) across the country, inspecting the car for defects, completing any cosmetic/mechanical/other types of repairs needed, and conducting a final quality check before making the car available for purchase by customers

Objective:
- Youâ€™ve noticed that the average cost to recondition a car for a specific IC has been increasing over time.
- The objective is to determine what might be contributing to this increase over time.
